## Introduction

**Gpipe** is a pipeline parallelism library that enables the training of large neural networks by partitioning them into smaller segments (stages) and distributing these across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs or TPUs). This approach allows for efficient utilization of hardware resources and reduces memory constraints during training.

This implementation leverages **JAX**, a high-performance numerical computing library that provides automatic differentiation, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, and parallelization capabilities. The addition of **mixed precision training** and **quantization** further enhances performance by reducing computational overhead and memory usage.

## Features

- **Model Partitioning**: Splits the neural network into partitions distributed across multiple devices.
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Utilizes JAX's `pmap` to perform parallel computation across devices.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Uses lower-precision data types (`float16`) for computations to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- **Quantization**: Parameters and activations are quantized to lower precision, effectively reducing the model size.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Uses JAX's `grad` and `value_and_grad` for efficient gradient computation.
- **Optimized Updates**: Integrates with **Optax** for gradient updates and optimization.
- **Microbatch Processing**: Processes data in microbatches to optimize device utilization and reduce memory overhead.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.7 or higher
- **JAX** and **JAXlib**
- **Optax** (optimization library for JAX)
- **NumPy**

## Installation

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jax jaxlib optax numpy
